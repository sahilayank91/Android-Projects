        The system uses the concept of demand side management,
        variable tariff blocks and its optimization on cloud such that the power consumption bill is minimized,
        peak load time is clipped and the consumer satisfaction is maximized. It records and analyzes the electrical
        parameters and provides an option for optimized scheduling for electrical appliances. The system provides
        real time access to the load parameters and there is a centralized data monitoring system which generates a
        report and provides alert to the user to reduce the load consumption on exceeding the proposed usage limit
        as determined by the predicted load. A smart control feature is integrated which enables control of all the
        appliances using a handheld device.The system also logs the power consumption so that the discrepancy in billing can be cut down.

<b>Progress:</b>\n\n
The following tasks have been done and integrated:
1) Retrieval of data from homes.\n

        <item><string name="quadcopter">Quad copters are really interesting topic for engineering students as it can perform versatile day to day functions.
        Also the military use of these type of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has grown because of their ability to operate in dangerous locations
        while keeping their human operators at a safe distance. A quadcopter, also called quadrotor helicopter is multi-rotor
        copter with four arms, each of which have a motor and a propeller at their ends. Quadcopters are similar to helicopters in some ways,
        though their lift and thrust comes from four propellers, rather than just one.


        \n\n<b>1.</b> Our idea is to design the quadcopter that when left
        in unknown terrains can give us live video stream on our laptops and also store it according to the need.\n
        <b>2.</b> Automate it so that it can act by judging its surroundings, perform various actions/maneuverers by determining its position and environment.\n
        <b>3.</b> These quad copters can be sent in evacuated buildings and in bio-chemical factories to act as first respondents, and call for cajole by manoeuvring either
        autonomously or controlling it through Brain.\n
        <b>4.</b> It can also be used to autonomously model unknown environments using distance measuring
        sensors and decide its path accordingly.\n</string></item>

        Brain Signals are detected by sensitive electrodes and filtered to obtain useful information.
        BCI is used for prognosis of terminal diseases, an aid for people who have been disabled and
        can be used as an ancillary part for paralyzed people. We have achieved the objective of categorizing patients

        <item><string name="multi_actuator">Current hydraulic systems involving multiple actuators and a single hydraulic power supply generally have poor efficiency.
        Using throttling valves to control multiple actuators requires meeting the
        highest pressure requirement and the total flow of all of actuators.
        When there is a large difference in the pressure requirement of the actuators,
        fluid throttling results in significant energy losses.
        The purpose of this project is to implement switch-mode control in a multi-actuator
        circuit and demonstrate the improvement in efficiency over a traditional hydraulic
        with throttling valve control. This will reduce energy losses and result in improved
        efficiency for usage of multiple actuators with a single hydraulic power source.
        This idea utilises the input from both the tank and the pump. Using varying amounts of
        fluid coming from both sources, we can create various pressure and flow values for different
        actuators and in the process increase the efficiency of the system by operating the actuators
        at their rated pressures and flows. The usages of this project vary from heavy duty hydraulic
        to hydraulic lifts. This new technology, once implemented on a larger scale in realistic applications,
        will reduce losses in hydraulic systems that depend on multiple actuators to function.</string></item>


        <item><string name="human_computer_interface">These Devices can range from simple screen modules to more advanced systems like\n

    Looking at the present scenario in India, we believe that cheap alternatives to the usually expensive equipment like interactive whiteboards\n

        \n \t The scope of our project and the applications in the real world are huge.To list a few,\n
    the following are few of the things which are aiming to achieve:

    \n
    <b>1.</b>Turning the projection of a laptop into an interactive environment, with multi touch features.

        <item><string name="voltage_inspection">The project is aimed at developing a robotic technology for carrying out the
    inspection and repair work of any faults that may occur in the
    transmission/distribution lines. The robot will achieve this task whilst the line being under
    live condition. Present methods of inspection include Helicopter surveillance and Human inspection.
    Helicopter surveillance is done by a lineman using helicopter and it is highly risky.
    The second method includes human inspection. In this lineman climbs on the transmission
    line and checks out all the faults and repairs them and this method is also highly risky and time consuming.
\n\n
    <b>The robotic system consists of a robot equipped with:</b>
<b>1.</b> A high definition video camera providing live feeds of transmission line\n
    <b>2. </b>Infrared (Thermal) camera providing the locations of hotspots.\n
<b>3.</b> Wire clamper and bolt lightener.\n
<b>4.</b> Wireless assembly providing control upto 2km.\n
The robotic system is manually controlled through a wireless remote.
    The video and infrared cameras provide live feeds which are transmitted wirelessly.
    The receiver kept near operator receives the live feeds and then they are displayed on the screen.
    The operator can then control the robotic system to repair the broken strands and can also analyze the hotspots.
    Loose bolts can be tightened by using the assembly mounted for tightening the bolts.
This way the system will minimize the human work, increase efficiency and reduce dangers in
    maintaining and repairing the transmission lines.</string></item>

        substitute to the Physiotherapists treating stroke patients The methodlogy involves:\n\n
<b>1.</b> Development of the tentative model on 3D modelling software.\n
<b>2.</b> Static and dynamic analysis using Hyperworks.\n
<b>3.</b> Development of the first prototype based on input and output systems.\n
<b>4.</b> Integration of input and output systems.\n
<b>5.</b> Integrating with Feedback control.</string></item>


        <item><string name="agastuti"><b>About</b>\n\n
<b>AGASTUTI</b> as the name suggests is an autonomous system which can replace human beings
        from the unproductive job of transporting objects from one place to another.
        Thus effectively saving human resources which can be used in other comparatively
        more productive jobs. The system consists of a CPU as any customized PC.
        The main aim is to achieve an autonomous navigation. The robot will further
        be used in hospitals where in case of an emergency the nearest ICU for the patient
        will be automatically be fetched from a UNIFIED database and will save the precious moments.
        The robot will feature various robotic sciences like Image Processing,etc.
        The interface with the robot will be via a touch screen An insight in the
        future a multiple number of these robots will be in sync with each other to
        make navigation very simple and efficient saving a lot of resources and man power.</string></item>

        <item><string name="hand_gesture">Some special people are usually deprived of normal communication with other people in the society.
        It has been observed that they find it really difficult at times to interact with normal people with their gestures ,
        as only a very few of those are recognized by most people. Since people with hearing impairment cannot talk like
        normal people so they have to depend on some sort of visual communication in most of the time. Visual-gestural
        language is their primary means of expression which involves various hand gestures , facial expressions like
        eyebrow movement and lip-mouth movement. What we aim to achieve ? The idea is to make computers to understand
        human language and develop a user friendly human computer interfaces (HCI). Making a computer understand speech,
        facial expressions and human gestures are some steps towards it thereby making a translation system that can
        successfully convert this visual gestural language into digital English text or speech.</string></item>
